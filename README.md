# **MULTIPLE DISEASE PREDICTION MODEL**

## **OVERVIEW**

*This project is a multiple disease prediction model designed to estimate the likelihood of heart disease and diabetes based on user inputs. Using a Logistic Regression algorithm, the model was trained on a comprehensive dataset sourced from Kaggle. Developed in Google Colab, the model was serialized with Pickle for deployment. The final product is a responsive web application built with Streamlit, enabling users to input their data and receive real-time predictions.*

## **TECHNOLOGIES AND LIBRARIES USED**

- **Python**: Core programming language used for model development and web application.
- **Google Colab**: Platform utilized for data preprocessing, model training, and experimentation.
- **Logistic Regression**: Machine learning algorithm employed to train the prediction model.
- **Kaggle Dataset**: Dataset used for training the model, encompassing features relevant to heart disease and diabetes.
- **Pickle**: Library used to serialize and deserialize the trained model for deployment.
- **Streamlit**: Framework used to create an interactive and responsive web application for user input and prediction results.
- **Spyder**: IDE used for integrating Streamlit and further development.
- **Anaconda**: Package and environment manager used to handle dependencies and environment setup.
- **NumPy**: Library utilized for numerical computations and handling arrays.
- **scikit-learn (sklearn)**: Library employed for machine learning tasks, including model training, evaluation, and deployment.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Optional libraries for visualizing data and model performance.

## **FEATURES**

- **Heart Disease Prediction**: Predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user inputs.
- **Diabetes Prediction**: Predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on user inputs.
- **Responsive Web Interface**: Streamlit-based web application allows users to easily input data and receive real-time predictions.
- **Serialized Model**: The trained model is saved and loaded using Pickle for efficient deployment and use.

**Multiple Disease Prediction Model**
**Overview**
This project is a multiple disease prediction model that predicts the likelihood of heart disease and diabetes. The model was trained using Logistic Regression on a dataset sourced from Kaggle and developed in Google Colab. The trained model was then imported using Pickle to create a responsive web application that allows users to input their data and receive predictions in real-time.

Technologies and Libraries Used
Python: Core programming language used for model development and web application.
Google Colab: Used for data preprocessing, model training, and experimentation.
Logistic Regression: Machine learning algorithm used to train the prediction model.
Kaggle Dataset: Dataset for heart disease and diabetes used to train the model.
Pickle: Library used to serialize the trained model for deployment.
Streamlit: Framework used to create a responsive web application for user input and prediction display.
Spyder: IDE used for Streamlit integration and further development.
Anaconda: Package manager and environment manager used to manage dependencies.
NumPy: Library used for numerical computations.
scikit-learn (sklearn): Library used for machine learning, including model development, training, and evaluation.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Optional libraries for visualizing data and model performance (if applicable).
Features
Heart Disease Prediction: Predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user inputs.
Diabetes Prediction: Predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on user inputs.
Responsive Web Interface: Streamlit-based web application allows users to easily input data and receive real-time predictions.
Serialized Model: The trained model is saved and loaded using Pickle for efficient deployment and use.
